## Consequences of Economic and Temperature differences

* In the 2022 Olympics, there were 91 countries and 109 gold medals awarded.

* No athlete from a tropical country has ever won a metal in the Winter Olympics(crazy right?)

* Don't believe us? https://olympics.com/en/news/which-tropical-nation-will-win-an-olympic-winter-games-medal 
* Olympians earn sponsorship from their athletic achievements

## Data Information

.pull-left[
* Pulled from Kaggle databases, was updated with medal count every other day as Olympics went on
* Used WorldBank to get most accurate and recent GDP information
* Summarized climate data by averaging temperature from past 4 years
* Population was from most recent census data(2020)

## Regression

.pull-center[
* Our regression function of how the average GDP of a country will affect its gold medal chances are as follows,
* $\hat{AverageGDP_i} = 859910.7+ 353262.9	* GoldMedals_i$
* Our R^2 value was 0.09337504

###Goals
.pull-center[
* Hypothesis: Olympians who live in a warmer climate or receive less funding are less likely to get attention or achieve good results
* Goal 1: Investigate for a correlation between both average temperature and medal count 
* Goal 2: Investigate for a correlation between GDP and medal count
