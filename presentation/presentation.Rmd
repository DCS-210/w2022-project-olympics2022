## Introduction
.pull-left[

* In the 2022 Olympics, there were 91 countries and 109 gold medals awarded.

* No athlete from a tropical country has ever won a medal in the Winter Olympics(crazy right?)

* Don't believe us? https://olympics.com/en/news/which-tropical-nation-will-win-an-olympic-winter-games-medal 
* Olympians earn sponsorship from their athletic achievements which allow them to train 
* With better training facilities and/or climate, do they have a better chance at a medal?

## Data Information

.pull-left[
* Pulled from Kaggle databases, was updated with medal count every other day as Olympics went on
* Used WorldBank to get most accurate and recent GDP information
* Summarized climate data by averaging temperature from past 4 years
* Population was from most recent census data(2020)
* We selected the 22 countries with the highest medal count for our analysis

###What our Goals were 
.pull-center[
* Hypothesis: Olympians who live in a warmer climate or receive less funding are less likely to get attention or achieve good results
* Goal 1: Investigate for a correlation between both average temperature and medal count 
* Goal 2: Investigate for a correlation between GDP and medal count

]

What we Achieved 
.pull-center[
* R^2 is estimated to be 1, which would estimate perfect estimation of the variability around the dependent variable. 
* Heat map shows possibility of temperature and medals correlation
* Seems unlikely that we would have perfect R^2, more regressions needed
